Soil Health Monitoring App
Welcome! This is a simple but powerful Flutter app designed to help you keep an eye on your soil's health. It's built to connect to a sensor, grab the latest temperature and moisture readings, and save them to a secure cloud backend. You can then view your data in real-time, either as a beautiful live chart or a detailed list of past reports.

What Can It Do?
Log In Securely: Your data is protected with a simple and secure email & password login system powered by Firebase.

Simulate a Real Sensor: Don't have the hardware? No problem! The app includes a mock Bluetooth service that generates realistic data, so you can test everything out.

See Live Data: Thanks to a real-time connection with a Firestore database, your data is always up-to-date. Any new reading you take will appear instantly.

Visualize Your Data: The home screen features a live-updating line chart, making it easy to spot trends in your soil's health at a glance.

View Detailed Reports: Need to see the numbers? A separate "Reports" screen lists all your past readings with exact timestamps.

Manage Your Data: Don't need an old report? Just swipe it away to delete it from the database.

Built on a Solid Foundation: The app uses the BLoC (Cubit) pattern for clean, predictable, and scalable state management.

Built With
Framework: Flutter

Language: Dart

Backend: Firebase (Authentication & Cloud Firestore)

State Management: flutter_bloc

Data Visualization: syncfusion_flutter_charts

Getting Started
Ready to run the app yourself? Hereâ€™s everything you need to get the project set up on your machine.

What You'll Need
The Flutter SDK (latest stable version is best).

A code editor you like (like VS Code or Android Studio).

An Android Emulator or a physical Android device to run the app on.

Step-by-Step Setup
Get the Code
First, you'll want to clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd soil_health_monitoring_app

Set Up Your Firebase Project
This is where your app's data will live.

Head over to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and give it a name.

Once your project is ready, click the Android icon to add an Android app.

For the Android package name, you can use com.example.soil_health_monitoring_app.

Download the google-services.json file that Firebase gives you and place it inside the android/app/ folder in your project.

Switch on the Firebase Services

In the Firebase Console, find the Authentication section. Click "Get Started" and enable the Email/Password sign-in option.

Next, go to the Firestore Database section. Click "Create database," choose to start in test mode, and select a cloud server location (like asia-south1 if you're in India).

Install the Project Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project's root folder and run:

flutter pub get

Run the App!

Make sure your Android emulator is running or your device is plugged in.

In your terminal, run:

flutter run

A Note on the Bluetooth Feature
It's a Simulation! This app doesn't connect to a real Bluetooth device. Instead, I created a mocked BluetoothService that generates random data. This was done to focus on building a solid app architecture (UI, state management, backend) without needing physical hardware. The service is designed so that a real Bluetooth implementation could be easily swapped in later with minimal fuss.

What You Get
Source Code: All the code is available in this repository.

A Ready-to-Install APK: To build your own release APK, just run the command below. You'll find the finished file in build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk.

flutter build apk --release
